                My reasons for joining this program
            </h3>
        </header>
        <ol>
            <li>I joined <a href="https://internship.zuri.team">
                    Zuri Internship</a> for the purpose of improving my coding skill</li>
            <li>For internship purpose. I would be having my SIWES very soon and I have no idea where to apply to. I know I have the skillset though I will admit that I'm not an expert but I believe with the amount of skills I have now, I should be able to
                get a place for my internship.
            </li>
            <li>I also to see how far I can go with this ðŸ™‚. I want to see what stage I can get to before being disqualified or if I don't get disqualified (What a dream that would be ðŸ™‚).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I' m also using this medium to thank you for this opportunity you have given us.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Personally I have learnt a little on Figma, git and github, HTML and CSS I learnt from a mentor but I found some YouTube videos I will put below helpful, I learnt JAVASCRIPT on YouTube as well but I recently got a link to a udemy course taken Jonas
        Schmedtmann (I watched his course when I was learning Scss and advanced css and he was amazing).</p>

    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Before moving on I also want to talk about the languages I learnt(which was also part of this stage). I'm a fan of using YouTube cause it is free and very helpful in several ways but I can also advice you to use others to learn like
            <a href="https://udemy.com">udemy</a>,
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>
        </p>

        <p>Naturally the assignment says that we should drop a beginner tutorial of Figma, Git, Html and any other programming language but I will say a few things on it before actually dropping the link. <span>Hopefully this is not an offenseðŸ¤ž</span></p>

                <h4>Figma: </h4>
                <p>This is mostly used by UI/UX developers but you can also see frontend developers and backend as well playing with the app. I actually can't remember the actual process of signing into FigmaðŸ˜…. The actual use of Figma is to get a pictorial
                    version of how your website or app will look like or even function. This is a short tutorial on Figma below that I believe will be helpful for beginners</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Git:</h4>
                <p>Git is a version control that we use to store our code online and then we can save it to an app like github, gitlab and others. We do such because we could be done with a project and we want to delete it there but there is possibility
                    of improving the website/app or even the code itself. The apps like github can also serve as a show-off of projects and also serve as resumes. There is also a great tutorial for beginners below</p>

            <section>
                <h4>HTML: </h4>
                <p>Html is a markup language. It is used to structure a website and nothing else. Let me use a real life example to define it. If a professional engineer is going to build an equipment, he is going to need a pictorial version of how the built
                    equipment should eventually look like, that aspect is what Figma is for while the equipment won't work if you know how it would look like and how it functions, so you need to get to building the equipment by getting the materials and
                    fixing the materials together, and that is the HTML. There are many detailed videos on HTML if the one below doesn't cover it all.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Javascript: </h4>
                <p>Remember I was relating programming in relation to building an equipment, Well we will proceed with that. The now packed together tool might have been arranged appropriately for reuse and much more. It will most likely not look good which
                    is where the CSS covers and after that the equipment will not be working yet because functionality hasn't been put in it yet. The moment functionality has been put into it, the equipment building phase is now complete. This functionality
                    aspect is the Javascript. The video below is loud and very explanatory.</p>
